Aqua Buddy is a Google Chrome Extension that will remind you to drink water based on the intervals you choose.

You can also set quiet hours and even turn on the "Do Not Disturb" mode to stop the notifications.

## Future Wishlist
 - Allow the user to record the amount of water they drink on daily basis
 - Based on the data, show trends as a bar chart

*I am open to further ideas to make this tiny little extension a little more useful!*
